## Introduction

General intelligence requires quick adaption across tasks. While existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods have made progress in generalization, they typically assume only distribution changes between source and target domains. In this paper, we explore a wider range of scenarios where not only the distribution but also the environment spaces may change. For example, in the CoinRun environment, we train agents from easy levels and generalize them to difficulty levels where there could be new enemies that have never occurred before. To address this challenging setting, we introduce a *causality-guided self-adaptive representation*-based approach, called CSR, that equips the agent to generalize effectively across tasks with evolving dynamics. Specifically, we employ causal representation learning to characterize the latent causal variables within the RL system. Such compact causal representations uncover the structural relationships among variables, enabling the agent to autonomously determine whether changes in the environment stem from distribution shifts or variations in space, and to precisely locate these changes. We then devise a three-step strategy to fine-tune the causal model under different scenarios accordingly. Empirical experiments show that CSR efficiently adapts to the target domains with only a few samples and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of scenarios, including our simulated environments, CartPole, CoinRun and Atari games.

Our key contributions are summarized below:
- We investigate a broader scenario towards generalizable reinforcement learning, where changes occur not only in the distributions but also in the environment spaces of latent variables, and propose a causality-guided self-adaptive representation-based approach to tackle this challenge.
- To characterize both the causal representations and environmental changes, we construct a world model that explicitly uncovers the structural relationships among latent variables in the RL system.
- By leveraging the compact causal representations, we devise a three-step strategy that can identify where the changes of the environment take place and add new causal variables autonomously if necessary. With this self-adaptive strategy, we achieve low-cost policy transfer by updating only a few parameters in the causal model.

## Requirements

The Python environment for experiments in each environment is provided in the corresponding subfolder.  
Please follow the instructions in the `README` file within each subfolder to install the required packages.

For example, for Atari100K:

```bash
cd atari100k  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Policy Adaptation

**CoinRun**

```bash
cd coinrun/world_model
xvfb-run --auto-servernum -s "-screen 0 1400x900x24" python -m world_model.main --configs coinrun --task coinrun --logdir ./world_model/results
```

**Atari100K**

```bash
cd atari100k
python3 main.py --configs atari100k --task atari_pong --logdir ./results/pong
```

## Benchmark Fork

> **This fork** ([`benchmark` branch](https://github.com/SSubhnil/CSR/tree/benchmark)) contains modifications for reproducing benchmark comparisons against [DRAMA](https://github.com/SSubhnil/CausalWorldModel). The original CSR code is available at [https://github.com/CMACH508/CSR](https://github.com/CMACH508/CSR).

### Modifications (atari100k only)

1. **ale-py migration** — replaced deprecated `atari-py` + `gym.envs.atari` with `ale-py` + `ale_py.roms` in the Atari wrapper
2. **Benchmark mode switching** — added `benchmark_switching` config flag that enables episode-boundary mode/difficulty switching via CausalWorldModel's `CSRModeSwitchWrapper`, alongside CSR's native 4-task sequential protocol

### Benchmark Setup (conda)

Requires [CausalWorldModel](https://github.com/SSubhnil/CausalWorldModel) as a sibling directory (or set `CAUSAL_WORLD_MODEL_ROOT` env var) when using `benchmark_switching` mode.

```bash
# 1. Clone repos as siblings
git clone -b benchmark https://github.com/SSubhnil/CSR.git
git clone https://github.com/SSubhnil/CausalWorldModel.git

# 2. Create conda env
conda create -n csr_atari python=3.10 -y
conda activate csr_atari

# 3. Install PyTorch with CUDA
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# 4. Install requirements
cd atari100k
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
cd atari100k

# Native CSR protocol (4-task sequential)
python main.py --configs atari100k --task atari_alien --logdir ./results/alien_native --seed 42

# Benchmark switching (episode-boundary mode switching, matches DRAMA protocol)
python main.py --configs atari100k --task atari_alien --logdir ./results/alien_benchmark \
  --benchmark_switching True --benchmark_switch_mode uniform --seed 42
```
